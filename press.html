		<h2>Top Ten Bars in New Orleans, 2016</h2>
		<p class="quote">"T. Cole Newton, who learned his skills at Commander's Palace and Coquette, proves at Twelve Mile Limit that you can run a laid-back neighborhood bar with reasonable prices, a solid list of craft beers and well-made cocktails that arrive in no time at all. Trivia nights, music, a pool table and casual weekend brunch have made the bar a neighborhood hub." </p>

		<h2>New Orleans Lively Bar Scene</h2>
		<p class="quote">"At Twelve-Mile Limit - a dive bar in the Mid-City neighborhood that was taken over by the bartender T. Cole Newton in 2010 and given a stealth quality cocktail program and impressive back bar - customers are regularly invited to "Name This Cocktail." The ingredients of a new creation are written on a chalkboard and stay there until someone creates an appropriate label. Sometimes the christened drink earns a permanent spot on the menu, as with the Mantis: rum, the Italian bitter Branca Menta, almond syrup and lime juice that tastes like a delicious alcoholic mouthwash. (Twelve-Mile Limit cocktails are not just good, they are dive-bar cheap, from $6 to $8.)"</p>

		<h2>Mini Guide to New Orleans Nightlife</h2>
		<p class="quote">"Twelve Mile Limit is simply a great bar. It's a neighbourhood joint in Mid-City so you'll need to make a special trip there, but the mixed drinks are excellent (strong), the cocktails creative and the vibe is accepting. The barbecue is spot on - try the pulled pork - plus they host free buffet dinners on Monday nights."</p>

		<h2>Best Bar in New Orleans is 12 Mile Limit</h2>
		<p class="quote">"Sometimes, you want a really great cocktail, yet at the same time, you don't necessarily want the atmosphere that usually accompanies a high-class, well-made cocktail. Twelve Mile Limit splits the difference, offering amazing drinks with a dive bar atmosphere. Better than that, though, is the fact that the cocktails are some of the best deals in the city for what you're getting. Most drinks hover between six and eight bucks, and there are also happy hour specials that knock the price down a little bit. New Orleans is a melting pot of culture and Twelve Mile Limit is the perfect, boozy epitome of that."</p>

		<h2>New Cocktails in N'awlins</h2>
		<p class="quote">"The bar scene at 12 Mile Limit plays fast and loose with preconceived notions as to what a high-end cocktail bar should be. There are no glowing Edison bulbs, no imported leather lounging nooks and no entree-priced cocktails. There are instead a pool table, several Louisiana State Lottery machines and an iron gate out front requiring patrons to be buzzed in - a matter of security rather than show. Mid-City is off the beaten path for most tourists, and even some cabdrivers, but those who sojourn out to Telemachus Street will be well rewarded for their troubles. 12 Mile Limitâ€™s relative isolation and workaday charm begets enormous creativity, as the bartender and owner T. Cole Newton (formerly of Coquette) affords himself free rein with a creative, accessible cocktail program priced well below the national standard."</p>
