    <p class="paragraphright">Born and raised in Washington, DC, T. Cole Newton graduated from Humboldt State University with honors in 2006, earning a BA in History. From there he moved to New Orleans, enrolling with AmeriCorps to volunteer full-time in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. After his service year, Cole found his first full-time bartending job at Commander's Palace, culinary alma mater of Paul Prudhomme and Emeril Lagasse. Cole developed a knack for bartending and hospitality, and in 2008 he developed and implemented the cocktail program as a founding staff member of the newly opened uptown bistro Coquette.</p>
    <p  class="paragraphright">Inspired by that experience, Cole opened his celebrated Mid City cocktail dive Twelve Mile Limit in 2010. Among other honors, Twelve Mile Limit has been named as one of the top ten bars in New Orleans by the New Orleans Times-Picayune every year that list has been published. In addition to operating his own bar, Cole has consulted on bar programs at a range of venues including the restaurant Square Root, the Orpheum Theater, and the Troubadour Hotel. He has also appeared on the Sundance Channel's Beyond the Bar series and is a fixture of cocktail competitions, having represented the United States at the International Bar Summit competition in Bordeaux, France, in 2014. Cole also enjoys skiing and horror movie-themed board games, and he recently beat Super Mario Bros. 3 for the first time without using a warp whistle.</p>

    <h4 class="h4left">What it's like to open a bar in a changing neighborhood</h4>
      <p class="paragraphleft">"Six years ago, I bought a bar with a bullet hole in the window. It was in a part of town where a lot of people who look like me - a white male of considerable privilege - were afraid to go. A lot has changed since then. Now, houses in the same neighborhood are selling for over half a million dollars, and my bar has been a pivotal part of that transition. While this has been great for me, I can't pretend that's been the case for everyone."  ...</p>

    <h4 class="h4center">How bartenders can prevent sexual harassment, assault</h4>
      <p class="paragraphcenter">"As a bartender and bar owner, I've struggled with many of the moral and ethical issues that surround my trade. Among the most troubling is the role that bars, and drinking more broadly, plays in sexual harassment and assault. Alcohol does not cause rape, but it's often involved, and if bar owners do not actively work to mitigate the role that we inadvertently play as purveyors, then we become part of the problem." ...</p>

      <p class="paragraphright">"With so much drama in the world, it can be difficult to remember that we are all part of a greater community tied together by love, decency and kindness. I share some responsibility for the darkness, I suppose - I write about bar ownership and my focus tends to be the negatives: rape culture, gentrification, entitlement and so on. A lot of bad things happen in bars, and we shouldn't ignore them." ...</p>
